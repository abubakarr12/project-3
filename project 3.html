        An old landslide gives this hillside, known for its folk tales about fairies, an otherworldly look.The Fairy Glen is a unique and unusual landscape, a geological wonder on the Isle of Skye. Created by an ancient landslip which has left plateaus seperated by cliffs at the higher levels and small steep hills at low levels. The often photographed stone circle does not belong here and was first created in 2013 by visitors. Locals work hard repeatedly clearing this sham stone circle. Please help us maintaine the NATURAL beauty of the Glen and do not alter anyting when you visit
